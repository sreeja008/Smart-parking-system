# 🚗 Smart Parking Prediction System
> **Enhancing Urban Parking Efficiency Through Machine Learning**

## 📌 Project Overview

Urban parking inefficiencies contribute significantly to traffic congestion, fuel consumption, and pollution. This project introduces a **Smart Parking Prediction System** that leverages **machine learning**, **computer vision**, and **dynamic pricing models** to streamline parking management in urban areas.

Developed using:
- 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithms: Random Forest, SVM, CNN
- 🎥 Computer Vision: OpenCV for real-time parking detection
- 🌐 Web Framework: Django for the user interface
- 📡 Integration: Smart city mobility platforms for scalable urban deployment
